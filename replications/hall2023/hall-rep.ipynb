    "One of the key aspects of the paper is using campaign contributions to figure out which of the two main candidates in a primary is more extreme. The standard way to estimate the ideology of politicians is to look at their voting records. However, a drawback of this is that we can't use it to figure out the ideology of candidates for office who don't win. Since the key goal of the paper is to figure out which candidate is more extreme, we can't use voting records along as losing candidates typically don't hold office to generate a voting recored. A nice feature of campaign contributions is that we can estimate the ideology of losing candidates.\n",
